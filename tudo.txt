check duplicare semantic variables
add binary search for (long) ranges
add more grammar analyzers
implement lookup tables (using starting characters of expressions) for the ordered choice expressions to improve the performance by skip unnecessary (heavy) operations
remove loop in postfix choice with single expression
exmaple postfix _e185 does not has return statement
implement analyzer warning when terminal isSucessful (zero length terminal)
implement analyzer warning when repetition child isSucessful (infinite loop)
does not generate unused rules in postfix generator
improve error message formatter (for Unicode)
find bug with "break"
does not generate unused global parser methods
make some classes private?
add command line option "optimize-size"
use bit masks in fast check in predict?
optimize internal check if repetitions cannot be non productive (ro reduce generated code)
inplement malformed terminals reporting
add support of memoization of inlining rules
rework isProductive from `bool` to { always, never, sometimes }
add parenthesis to unary operator printer
improve variable usage optimizer
