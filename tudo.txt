optimize caller id assignment?
check duplicare semantic variables
add binary search for (long) ranges
add more grammar analyzers
implement optimizer to remove "_succes = true" before calls to [_parseXXX, _matchXXX]
implement lookup tables (using starting characters of expressions) for the ordered choice expressions to improve the performance by skip unnecessary (heavy) operations
remove loop in postfix choice with single expression
exmaple postfix _e185 does not has return statement
implement analyzer warning when terminal isSucessful (zero length terminal)
implement analyzer warning when repetition child isSucessful (infinite loop)
does not generate unused rules in postfix generator
improve error message formatter (for Unicode)
find bug with "break"
use silence in postfix generator
does not generate unused global parser methods
make some classes private?
add command line option "optimize-size"
add resolver of unused rules
use bit masks in fast check in predict?
optimize internal check if repetitions cannot be non productive (ro reduce generated code)
inplement malformed terminals reporting
